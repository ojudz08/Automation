    HELP
    Dash components are declarative: every configurable aspect of these components is set during instantiation as a keyword argument.

    Call help in your Python console on any of the components to learn more about a component and its available arguments.



    SUMMARY
    The layout of a Dash app describes what the app looks like. The layout is a hierarchical tree of components.

    Dash HTML Components (dash.html) provides classes for all of the HTML tags and the keyword arguments describe the HTML attributes 
        like style, class, and id. Dash Core Components (dash.dcc) generates higher-level components like controls and graphs.
